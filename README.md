# Pew.js

Pew.js is a 2D HTML5 game engine focused on developer happiness, with a core API focused around modular, interchangeable components.

## Status

Pew is still under development. It currently relies on [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) as its rendering engine.


## Examples

You can find examples [here](https://github.com/apophanystudios/examples), which is also included as a submodule within this repository. The tags within the examples repository correspond to the release tags found within this repo.

## Contributing

Due to the early nature of the project, I currently am not accepting pull requests. Sorry!

As the project matures and the core API stabilizes, this will hopefully change. Feel free to file issues and start playing with the early release candidates in the meantime.
