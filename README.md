# Pew.js

Pew.js is a 2D HTML5 game engine focused on developer happiness, with a core API focused around modular, interchangeable components.

## Status

## Features

Under construction. POC components currently implemented include an

1. Input module (keyboard/mouse-only),
2. Collision engine
  a. Contact cache
  b. (basic) Collision resolution
3. Basic Physics Engine (Eulerian)
4. Game loop/Object pool

Short Term Roadmap

1. Extending the physics engine
2. Audio
3. DOM integration.
4. Text engine
5. Camera
6. Gamepad integration

Would be nice...:

1. basic AI patterns

## Examples

You can find examples [here](https://github.com/apophanystudios/examples), which is also included as a submodule within this repository. The tags within the examples repository correspond to the release tags found within this repo.

## Contributing

Due to the early nature of the project, I currently am not accepting pull requests. Sorry!

As the project matures and the core API stabilizes, this will hopefully change. Feel free to file issues and start playing with the early release candidates in the meantime.
