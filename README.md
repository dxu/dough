# Pew.js

Pew.js is a 2D HTML5 game engine focused on simplifying game development for the web.

## Status

Pew is under construction and constantly changing. As of now, it is built on top of [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) as its rendering engine and [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) as its physics engine.

## Examples

You can find a few examples under the `docs` folder, though these are currently POC's.
